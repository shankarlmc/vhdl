<======= First Of All Put the VHDL folder into C Drive ==========>
<=======Add new path variable for GHDL => C:\vhdl\GHDL\bin ===>
<=======Add new path variable for GTKWAVE =>C:\vhdl\gtkwave\bin =>


now open command prompt and go to the directory where you created andgate.vhdl and type these commands:


1. ghdl -a andgate.vhdl
2. ghdl -a andgate_testbench.vhdl
3. ghdl -e andgate_testbench
4. ghdl -r andgate_testbench
5. ghdl -r andgate_testbench -- vcd = andgate.vcd

at last for the waveform we have to type 
          gtkwave andgate.vcd
